no stress:
  the subjects are allowed to work on the tasks as long as they needed for a maximum
  of 45 minutes but they are not aware of the maximum duration of their tasks.
time pressure: 
  during this time, the time to finish the task was reduced to 2/3 of 
  the time the participant took in the neutral condition.
interruption:
  the participants received eight emails in the middle of their assigned tasks.
  Some emails were relevant to their tasks and the participant 
  was requested to take specific actions while others were 
  just irrelevant to their tasks.
無壓力：
   讓受試者在最大需要的時間內完成任務
   45 分鐘，但他們不知道任務的最長持續時間。
時間壓力：
   在此期間，完成任務的時間減少到了2/3
   參與者在中性條件下花費的時間。
中斷：
   參與者在分配任務的過程中收到了八封電子郵件。
   一些電子郵件與他們的任務和參與者相關
   被要求採取具體行動，而其他行動則
   只是與他們的任務無關。

These features represent various statistical, frequency domain, 
and non-linear measures derived from heart rate variability (HRV) data, 
which is often used to assess the autonomic nervous system's 
activity and cardiovascular health.
