The dataset may support studies on mental health and psychophysiology 
related to other anxiety disorders, such as fear of flying, social phobia 
and posttraumatic stress disorder.

The focus of this research is the usage of physiological responses for 
anxiety level detection. The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) produces 
physiological responses to regulate body functions, such as heart activity. 
Important physiological responses related to stress and anxiety can be 
derived from electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), 
and respiration (RSP) signals [18].

BitalinoBR.txt:
  Respiration in % (column 1, indicates the deflection of the piezo sensor 
  in the chest strap), value range from -50% to 50%; 
  timestamp with format hhmmss.milliseconds (column 2, used for the mapping of the video clip 
  time windows); label for RAW data (column 3, can be ignored).
BitalinoECG.txt: 
  Electrocardiogram in mV (column 1), value range from -1.5 mV to 1.5 mV; 
  timestamp with format hhmmss.milliseconds (column 2, used for 
  the mapping of the video clip time windows); label for RAW data (column 3, can be ignored).
BitalinoGSR.txt: 
  Skin conductance in uS (column 1), value range from -12.6 uS to 41 uS 
  (negative values are sensor-related, values should be treated with offset correction); 
  timestamp with format hhmmss.milliseconds (column 2, used for 
  the mapping of the video clip time windows); label for RAW data (column 3, can be ignored).
Triggers.txt: 
  Trigger-ID using CLIP-1 to CLIP-16 as anxiety stimulating video clips (column 1) 
  and BIOFEEDBACK-REST for the resting phase; timestamp with format hhmmss for start 
  (column 2) and end (column 3) of the video clip or resting phase.
